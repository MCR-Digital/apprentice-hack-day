<!--- ORGANISER THINGS TO CONSIDER 
- Which technical competencies, behaviours and knowledge module topics does the bootcamp cover/meet
- Structuring retros so that they can inform thinking for individual's personal learning records (off the job training record tab in their learning logs)
- Introducing some sort of test or quiz on basic concept learning points from the bootcamp to validate that they have taken stuff in, and provide organisation mentors with results to help them focus follow ups

## Mentors / Languages
 
One Mentor per Hack Team (five teams total).

Mentors will be available via Slack in the run up to the event to offer advice/guidance in planning.

Mentors will support their team on the day of the Hack.

## Prep-work for apprentices

Plan an idea for the Hack - based on the information in the brief. Come ready to hit the ground running on the day, but do not wirte any code beforehand. 

### Follow-on tasks

Organisation mentors should look to exercise the knowledge we’ve covered in the boot camp. Below are suggestions for tasks that would do this, but please use your own judgement to work out what to do. There is no need for anything to be returned to MD or the presenters—it’s just a learning exercise.

* Review what was achieved on the day and look at ideas for enhancements / how it could be improved with more time. 

## Further reading / learning resources

<!--- For end of boot camp: Signposting for apprentices self study, further learning, online resources, practice etc. --->

# Working with the slides

The slides are stored as Markdown files in `docs/_posts` and are presented using a combination of Jekyll and [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/). A [remote Jekyll theme](https://github.com/autotraderuk/jekyll-revealjs) is used to help make changes to the Jekyll code centrally.

The easiest way to preview your changes locally is to use docker to run Jekyll. To do this, [install docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) if you haven’t already and run `docker-compose up` from the root of this project in a terminal. Your changes will be visible on <http://localhost:4000/>. Any changes you make to the slides will be reflected in your browser—there’s no need to restart docker. You can hit `ctrl-c` to stop the process.

Once you push your changes the slides will be published using GitHub Pages automatically (see the link at the top of the repository).
